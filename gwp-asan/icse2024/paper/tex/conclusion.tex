\section{Conclusion}

Memory safety remains a major unresolved problem. The industry must migrate
away from memory-unsafe code, but this will take decades. In the meantime,
tools like GWP-ASan offer a low-overhead and easy-to-deploy option for bug
detection in production. These tools rely on telemetry systems that send crash
reports to developers. They must be used along with available pre-production
detection mechanisms and security mitigations.

GWP-ASan is not a security mitigation mechanism. When used, however, it
improves the overall product security by allowing developers to detect and fix
many vulnerabilities.
